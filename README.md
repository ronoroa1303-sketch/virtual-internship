Prompt-Driven Case Study (Geldium Financial Services)
Important Disclosure
This project was completed using Generative AI (Gemini) through structured prompt engineering.
- No Python model training was performed
- No machine learning code was written
- No production system was built

The project focuses on AI-assisted analytical reasoning, business decision design, and responsible AI thinking

This repository demonstrates how modern analysts can use GenAI as a decision-support tool, not traditional coding skills.

## Business Objective

To explore how a financial services company (Geldium) could use AI-assisted analytics to:
1. Identify early signals of credit delinquency
2. Reduce default rates through proactive intervention
3. Design an ethical, explainable, and scalable collections strategy

The emphasis is on decision-making impact, not algorithm implementation.

 ## Methodology (Prompt-Based Workflow)
Using carefully designed prompts, the following analytical stages were completed:

1️. Exploratory Data Understanding

- Reviewed dataset structure and feature types

- Identified missing values and data inconsistencies

- Highlighted behavioral risk patterns (utilization, missed payments)

2️. AI-Generated Predictive Reasoning

- Conceptual binary classification logic for delinquency

- AI-assisted reasoning on feature importance

- Validation through cross-prompt questioning (no execution)

3️. Business Insight Translation

- Converted analytical insights into operational actions

- Designed customer risk segmentation (Low / Medium / High)

4️. Ethical & Responsible AI Review

- Fairness checks (age, location, customer segment)

- Explainability requirements

- Human-in-the-loop decision safeguards

## Key Insights (AI-Assisted)

1. Credit Utilization and Debt-to-Income ratio are stronger indicators than credit score

2. Business and Student cardholders show elevated delinquency risk

3. Early financial nudges can reduce default probability

4. Reactive collections are costlier than preventive engagement

5. These insights were derived through iterative prompting and validation, not statistical computation.

## Conceptual Predictive Model (No-Code)

Model Type: Logistic Regression (conceptual design only)

Purpose: Estimate probability of delinquency

Inputs: Behavioral, financial, and demographic attributes

Output: Risk classification for intervention planning

This represents how a model would be designed in practice, not an implemented system.

## AI-Driven Collections Strategy (Conceptual)

Risk Level	AI-Assisted Action
Low Risk	Automated gentle reminders
Medium Risk	Personalized financial health nudges
High Risk	Human agent review & hardship plans

Designed to prioritize customer support over punitive recovery.

## Responsible AI Principles Applied

1. Transparency in AI-assisted decisions

2. Fair treatment across customer groups

3. Human oversight for high-impact outcomes

4. Regulatory awareness (explainability & compliance mindset)

## Skills Demonstrated

1. Prompt engineering for analytics

2. AI-assisted decision making

3. Business insight generation

4. Ethical AI reasoning

5. Financial risk understanding

6. Translating AI output into strategy
